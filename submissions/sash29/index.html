   <h4>But lets make this not about me...let's ramble on something a bit more general</h4>
   <p>...like...if u are given the chance to vote for a choice that can tweak the seasons that visit u all year round </p>
   </header>
</article>
</main>
<p>...more specifically, what if there is a proper<span><em> rainy 'season'</em></span>in the year instead of sporadic,scattered rain showers here and there.</p>
<p> Heavy,regular showers, maybe torrential downpours on some days...spanning over around a month </p>
<p> Lets go ahead and give it a thought, lets measure up the pros and cons a little</p>
<div class="pros_cons"><h3>The pros may be:</h3></div>
<ul>
<p><li>Thriving VEGETATION.Gardens blooming with<span> <h4>flowers</h4>.Backyard veggie patches flourishing with new and multiple types of<span><h4> shiny green healthy vegetables</h4></span>,hence more varied dinners everynight!</li>
<li>Cleaner, washed driveways and garden benches(that only the birds and dust have lately decided to "sit" on). Even your car waiting outside gets a queaky clean wash at no additional cost.</li>
<li>Its like Spring suddenly discovered the bottle of Steroids!<img src></li></p></ul>

<div class="pros_cons"><h3>And the cons are:<span><em>...drum roll please...</em></span></h3></div>
<ul>
<p><li>Thriving GERMS! Lesser we discuss on this, the better(ahem!)</li>
<li>Messier, dirtier foyers in our homes...and the resulting music from the lady of the house that could 'enliven' your rainy days even more</li>
<li>Bye Bye BBQs and camping out</li>
<li>Nature doesnt exacly always show up in benevolent forms. U imagine an idyllic scene...,but u end up getting strangled as the veggie patch turns into a monster,
    your gardens are more like a riot of rogues.U see vines and creepers creeping up in your dreams and choking u in your nightmares.</li></p>
<p><h3>U dream of this,<img src="images/april_flowers.jpg"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQInZtYglT8B___0FnMzMPZhX5thZXRBfUyudamUhgeTZiAVRso"/></p><h3>... U get this instead...</h3><p>
